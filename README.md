#### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

 # About me : 
   I'm Lakshmi Narayanan, a 17 years-old guy, who loves programming. 
   I prefer trees and a cup of tea with OVER headphones and GAME-ON.
   A Morning-bird.
  Loves to talk anything about programming.
  Introvert, trying to become an extrovert.
  There is 3 points in life. 2 points are not in your control. The only thing under your control is the distance between the first and the last point.
The distance between the birth and the death is the only thing under your control. 
  So,

 # Experiences:     Date [22/11/2020]
  âœ¨ C++: 2 years(From my high-school)
  âœ¨ MySQL : 1 year(From my high-school)
  âœ¨ Python:6-months(Self-taught)
  âœ¨ Dart & Flutter :4-months(Self-taught)
   
   C++, oh well, I was taught c++ in my high-school. And there begins my love for programming. I was really really lucky to get an awesome teacher for my Computer Science in high-school. Never got distracted in my CS classes. Skipped multiple Physics classes to go to the computer lab to learn something new. Yeah, since it was just school, I was taught only the basics and I never knew what was c++ capable of. Quarantine has taught me many things and the answer for the previous talk was given. 
  âœ¨ MySQL, not pretty much, I just worked on it for the assignments and the tests as I did not find it interesting. As always, realized later about Databases and how they shape the internet world. 
  âœ¨ Python, I started learning it while I wanted to quit gaming(Was really addicted to a game CSGO). I started learning it as it was one of the most demanded languages in 2020. Well, it was quite easy at the first. I put in 5 hours a day learning Python. While it came to implementation and doing stuff, I found it feasible. Learned a-lot from Python as it was for research purposes. After I completed exploring Python(No actually not, realized later that I did not explore much, check #shocked), after I made the Dictionary app, I was interested in Mobile App Dev, so, started to look for the perfect tool. And here comes, Dart & Flutter.
  âœ¨ I put in 12 hours a day learning Flutter. I loved every part, every widget, it was like, made ready, for me to use. Never got bored or procastinated in the case of flutter as it was a fantastic tool for me to kill time. Not sure why it's still not famous.
   
        
        
 # What I have done :        
âœ¨ I'm experienced in Flutter mobile app development, created several apps for family groups, friends such as Chat app, Xylophone app, a social-platform app, Wiz Card app, Weather app, and other small apps. Coming to Python, I'm not really experienced in Python, but I'm into exploring it more. I've created several apps with Python for mobile(which i regretted later for not knowing Flutter at that time) using the Kivy library, A Book-Managar database app for desktops,  I created a Motivational app which gives random quotes on Lockscreen, I've created a Dictionary app using hard logic of-course, I've created a YT video Downloader app which is no longer available(Because of the removal of a package). I've worked on Face detection,  Web Scrapping, Volcano & population maps, Email sender.., etc. C++, I'm good with problem solving, errors compiling. I've created a Railway reservation system, nothing special with C++.
      

# Shocked(just a small thing)
  I always wanted to work on hard things. I wanted to create a Instagram clone(which I later created using Flutter and Firebase(as the database)). So I was having my dinner and I was just googling random things like, what is the popular programming language and stuff. And, I googled "Programming language in which Instagram is created" and Google popped up with a bold, huge text "Python". I was real real shocked. Like wtf, I worked on Python for 6 months and I found nothing about that?!
  Yeah, maybe in 2011, Python was not famous, but was pretty neat.. Like now, Flutter is not real famous, but is real good.
